This project involved performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Netflix titles using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The dataset included information such as title, type (movie or TV show), genre, release year, country, cast, director, and date added to Netflix.

The objective was to uncover meaningful insights and trends from the data, which was achieved through the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and formatted date columns for consistency.

Feature Engineering: Extracted year, month, and other relevant features to support time-based analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Analyzed the growth of Netflix's content library over time

Compared the number of movies vs TV shows

Identified top genres and most frequent contributors (actors/directors)

Examined content distribution by country and release year

Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations like bar charts, heatmaps, and time series plots for better interpretation of trends.

This project demonstrates skills in Python programming, pandas, data visualization, and drawing actionable insights from real-world datasets. It also highlights the ability to communicate findings effectively through clean code and visual storytelling.
